# WEB3-VUE

last change: 

A. actually creating a Vue instance. To create a Vue instance, I called the createApp method of the Vue object and store the result in a variable. Then, I mounted the instance to a specific element using the mount method.

B. update the "removeTodo" method in the Vue instance. Currently, it's looping through the list of to-do items and trying to find the item with the matching id. But, it's not removing the item correctly, and that's why the "Remove" button is not working.
